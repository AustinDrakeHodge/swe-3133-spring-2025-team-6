# swe-3133-spring-2025-team-6
Welcome to the project repository for team 6. Here you will find all of our presentations, documentation, and source code for our SWE 3313 class project.
We will be building an e-commerce site with Java Spring framework, with our data being stored in SQLite, that sells unique video game items. The project will allow users to create accounts to buy the items for sale, and it will contain admininstration capabilities to allow the administrator to add inventory and run sales reports.

## Project Plan
### Resumes:
- [Austin Hodge](/Resumes/AustinHodge.md)
- [Jay Jalla](/Resumes/JayJalla.md)
- [Connor Craig](/Resumes/ConnorCraig.md)
  
We began by deciding the language that best suited our experience. From there, we decided the framework and database storage that would be best suited for our needs, followed by the breakdown of roles for the project.
### Team Assignments
- To ensure each member has a part of the project to focus on, we separated into four roles: Project Lead, Software Architect, Front-End Developer, and Back-End Developer

### Technology Description
- We are building our application using Java and implementing it with the Spring framework. We will be using SQLite to store the data for users, administrators, and the items that will be hosted on the website.

## Requirements
Here in the requirements phase of our project, we will discuss the needs and wants of our client. In our requirements writing, we separate each requirement by assigning them a priority, an estimated effort, and deciding whether they are functional/non-functional, and we group them based on their epics or stories that they are related to. Our use case diagram outlines the users and interactions they have with the system. Finally, our decision table maps the condition of the users to what actions they must/may take next. View our video at the bottom to be able to get a summary of this process.

## User Interface Design
Below is a high-fidelity design of the user interface that the client can expect. In this design, the client can click through the different pages and features of the site such as login, signup, admin, logistics, checkout, items, and more.
